If you want to develop a specific feature and merge it back, it's better to notify me beforehand. You can either open a issue, poke me on gitter or send me an email, I'll respond as fast as possible!

And don't forget to credit yourself! :clap:

## Installation

### CocoaPods
Add Instructions to your Podfile:

```ruby
source 'https://github.com/CocoaPods/Specs.git'
platform :ios, '9.0'
use_frameworks!

pod 'Instructions', '~> 1.0.0'
```

Then, run the following command:

```bash
$ pod install
```

### Carthage
Add Instructions to your Cartfile:

```
github "ephread/Instructions" ~> 1.0.0
```

You can then update, build and drag the generated framework into your project:

```bash
$ carthage update
$ carthage build
```

### Manually
If you rather stay away from both CocoaPods and Carthage, you can also install Instructions manually, with the cost of managing updates yourself.

#### Embedded Framework
1. Drag the Instructions.xcodeproj into the project navigator of your application's Xcode project.
2. Still in the project navigator, select your application project. The target configuration panel should show up.
3. Select the appropriate target and in the "General" panel, scroll down to the section named "Embedded Binaries".
4. Click on the + button and select the "Instructions.framework" under the "Product" directory.

## Usage

### Getting started
Open up the controller for which you wish to display coach marks and instantiate a new `CoachMarksController`. You should also provide a `dataSource`, which is an object conforming to the `CoachMarksControllerDataSource` protocol.

```swift
class DefaultViewController: UIViewController, CoachMarksControllerDataSource, CoachMarksControllerDelegate {
    let coachMarksController = CoachMarksController()

    override func viewDidLoad() {
        super.viewDidLoad()

        self.coachMarksController.dataSource = self
    }
}
```

#### Data Source
`CoachMarksControllerDataSource` declares three mandatory methods.

The first one asks for the number of coach marks to display. Let's pretend that you want to display only one coach mark. Note that the `CoachMarksController` requesting the information is supplied, allowing you to supply data for multiple `CoachMarksController`, within a single dataSource.

```swift
func numberOfCoachMarks(for coachMarksController: CoachMarksController) -> Int {
    return 1
}
```

The second one asks for metadata. This allows you to customize how a coach mark will position and appear, but won't let you define its look (more on this later). Metadata are packaged in a struct named `CoachMark`. Note the parameter `coachMarkAt`, it gives you the coach mark logical position, much like and `IndexPath` would do. `coachMarksController` provides you with an easy way to create a default `CoachMark` object, from a given view.

```swift
let pointOfInterest = UIView()

func coachMarksController(_ coachMarksController: CoachMarksController,
                              coachMarkAt index: Int) -> CoachMark {
    return coachMarksController.helper.makeCoachMark(for: pointOfInterest)
}
```

The third one supplies two views (much like `cellForRowAtIndexPath`) in the form a Tuple. The _body_ view is mandatory, as it's the core of the coach mark. The _arrow_ view is optional.

But for now, lets just return the default views provided by Instructions.

```swift
func coachMarksController(_ coachMarksController: CoachMarksController, coachMarkViewsAt index: Int, madeFrom coachMark: CoachMark) -> (bodyView: CoachMarkBodyView, arrowView: CoachMarkArrowView?) {
    let coachViews = coachMarksController.helper.makeDefaultCoachViews(withArrow: true, arrowOrientation: coachMark.arrowOrientation)

    coachViews.bodyView.hintLabel.text = "Hello! I'm a Coach Mark!"
    coachViews.bodyView.nextLabel.text = "Ok!"

    return (bodyView: coachViews.bodyView, arrowView: coachViews.arrowView)
}
```

#### Starting the coach marks flow
Once the `dataSource` is set up, you can start displaying the coach marks. You will most likely supply `self` to `start`. While the overlay adds itself as a child of the current window (to be on top of everything), the `CoachMarksController` will add itself as a child of the view controller you provide. That way, the `CoachMarksController` will receive size change events and react accordingly. Be careful, you can't call `start` in the `viewDidLoad` method, since the view hierarchy has to be set up and ready for Instructions to work properly.

```swift
override func viewDidAppear(animated: Bool) {
    super.viewDidAppear(animated)

    self.coachMarksController.start(on: self)
}
```

#### Stopping the coach marks flow
You should always stop the flow, once the view disappear. To avoid animation artefacts and timing issues, don't forget to add the following code to your `viewWillDisappear` method. Calling `stop(immediately: true)` will ensure that the flow is stopped immediately upon the disappearance of the view.

```swift
override func viewWillDisappear(animated: Bool) {
    super.viewWillDisappear(animated)

    self.coachMarksController.stop(immediately: true)
}
```

You're all set. For more examples you can check the `Examples/` directory provided with the library.

### Advanced Usage

#### Customizing general properties
You can customized the background color of the overlay using this property:

- `overlay.color`

You can also make the overlay blur the content sitting behind it. Setting this property to anything else than `nil` will disable the `overlay.color`:

- `overlay.blurEffectStyle: UIBlurEffectStyle?`

The overlay can sit over the status bar or under, the property defaults to `true`:

- `overlay.isShownAboveStatusBar: Bool`

The window level at which show the overlay and the coach mark, by default, the property holds `UIWindowLevelNormal + 1`.

- `overlay.windowLevel: UIWindowLevel`

Last, you can make the overlay tappable. A tap on the overlay will hide the current coach mark and display the next one.

- `overlay.allowTap: Bool`

⚠️ When using a blur effect, setting the window level to anything above `UIWindowLevelStatusBar`
is not supported.

#### Providing a custom cutout path
If you dislike how the default cutout path looks like, you can customize it by providing a block to `makeCoachMark(for:)`. The cutout path will automatically be stored in the `cutoutPath` property of the returning `CoachMark` object:

```swift
var coachMark = coachMarksController.helper.makeCoachMark(for: customView) {
(frame: CGRect) -> UIBezierPath in
    // This will create an oval cutout a bit larger than the view.
    return UIBezierPath(ovalIn: frame.insetBy(dx: -4, dy: -4))
}
```

`frame` will be the frame of `customView` converted in the `coachMarksController.view` referential, so don't have to worry about making sure the coordinates are in the appropriate referential. You can provide any kind of shape, from a simple rectangle to a complex star.

#### Providing custom views
You can (and you should) provide custom views. A coach mark is composed of two views, a _body_ view and an _arrow_ view. Note that the term _arrow_ might be misleading. It doesn't have to be an actual arrow, it can be anything you want.

A _body_ view must conform to the `CoachMarkBodyView` protocol. An _arrow_ view must conform to the `CoachMarkArrowView` protocol. Both of them must also be subclasses of `UIView`.

Returning a `CoachMarkBodyView` view is mandatory, while returning a `CoachMarkArrowView` is optional.

##### CoachMarkBodyView Protocol #####
This protocol defines two properties.

- `nextControl: UIControl? { get }` you must implement a getter method for this property in your view, this will let the `CoachMarkController` know which control should be tapped, to display the next coach mark. Note that it doesn't have to be a subview, you can return the view itself.

- `highlightArrowDelegate: CoachMarkBodyHighlightArrowDelegate?` in case the view itself is the control receiving taps, you might want to forward its highlight state to the _arrow_ view (so they can look as if they are the same component). The `CoachMarkController` will automatically set an appropriate delegate to this property. You'll then be able to do this:

```swift
override var highlighted: Bool {
	didSet {
	    self.highlightArrowDelegate?.highlightArrow(self.highlighted)
	}
}
```

##### Taking orientation into account #####
Remember the following method, from the dataSource?

```swift
func coachMarksController(_ coachMarksController: CoachMarksController, coachMarkViewsAt index: Int, madeFrom coachMark: CoachMark) -> (bodyView: CoachMarkBodyView, arrowView: CoachMarkArrowView?) {
	let coachViews = coachMarksController.helper.makeDefaultCoachViews(withArrow: true, arrowOrientation: coachMark.arrowOrientation)
}
```

When providing a customized view, you need to provide an _arrow_ view with the approriate orientation (i. e. in the case of an actual arrow, pointing upward or downward). The `CoachMarkController` will tell you which orientation it expects, through the following property: `CoachMark.arrowOrientation`.

Browse the `Example/` directory for more details.

#### Customizing how the coach mark will show
You can customize the following properties:

- `animationDuration: NSTimeInterval`: the time it will take for a coach mark to appear or disappear on the screen.

- `gapBetweenBodyAndArrow: CGFloat`: the vertical gap between the _body_ and the _arrow_ in a given coach mark.

- `pointOfInterest: CGPoint?`: the point toward which the arrow will face. At the moment, it's only used to shift the arrow horizontally and make it sits above or below the point of interest.

- `gapBetweenCoachMarkAndCutoutPath: CGFloat`: the gap between the coach mark and the cutout path.

- `maxWidth: CGFloat`: the maximum width a coach mark can take. You don't want your coach marks to be too wide, especially on iPads.

- `horizontalMargin: CGFloat` is the margin (both leading and trailing) between the edges of the overlay view and the coach mark. Note that if the max width of your coach mark is less than the width of the overlay view, you view will either stack on the left or on the right, leaving space on the other side.

- `arrowOrientation: CoachMarkArrowOrientation?` is the orientation of the arrow (not the coach mark, meaning setting this property to `.Top` will display the coach mark below the point of interest). Although it's usually pre-computed by the library, you can override it in `coachMarksForIndex:` or in `coachMarkWillShow:`.

- `disableOverlayTap: Bool` is used to disable the ability to tap on the overlay to show the next coach mark, on a case-by-case basis.

- `allowTouchInsideCutoutPath: Bool` is used to allow touch forwarding inside the cutout path. Take a look at `TransitionFromCodeViewController`, in the `Example/` directory, for more information.

#### Let users skip the tour
##### Control
You can provide the user with a mean to skip the coach marks. First, you will need to set
`skipView` with a `UIView` conforming to the `CoachMarkSkipView` protocol. This protocol defines a single property:

```swift
public protocol CoachMarkSkipView : class {
    var skipControl: UIControl? { get }
}
```

You must implement a getter method for this property in your view. This will let the `CoachMarkController` know which control should be tapped, to skip the tour. Note that, again, it doesn't have to be a subview, you can return the view itself.

As usual, Instructions provides a default implementation of `CoachMarkSkipView` named `CoachMarkSkipDefaultView`.

##### dataSource
To define how the view will position itself, you can use a method from the `CoachMarkControllerDataSource` protocol. This method is optional.

```swift
func coachMarksController(_ coachMarksController: CoachMarksController, constraintsForSkipView skipView: UIView, inParent parentView: UIView) -> [NSLayoutConstraint]?
```

This method will be called by the `CoachMarksController` before starting the tour and whenever there is a size change. It gives you the _skip button_ and the view in which it will be positioned and expects an array of `NSLayoutConstraints` in return. These constraints will define how the _skip button_ will be positioned in its parent. You should not add the constraints yourself, just return them.

Returning `nil` will tell the `CoachMarksController` to use the defaults constraints, which will position the _skip button_ at the top of the screen. Returning an empty array is discouraged, as it will most probably lead to an akward positioning.

For more information about the skip mechanism, you can check the `Example/` directory.

#### Piloting the flow from the code
Should you ever need to programmatically show the coach mark, `CoachMarkController.flow` also provides the following method:

```swift
func showNext(numberOfCoachMarksToSkip numberToSkip: Int = 0)
```

You can specify a number of coach marks to skip (effectively jumping to a further index).

Take a look at `TransitionFromCodeViewController`, in the `Example/` directory, to get an idea of how you can leverage this method, in order to ask the user to perform certain actions.

#### Using a delegate
The `CoachMarkController` will notify the delegate on multiple occasions. All those methods are optionals.

First, when a coach mark will show. You might want to change something about the view. For that reason, the `CoachMark` metadata structure is passed as an `inout` object, so you can update it with new parameters.

```swift
func coachMarksController(_ coachMarksController: CoachMarksController, willShow coachMark: inout CoachMark, at index: Int)
```

Second, when a coach mark disappears.

```swift    
func coachMarksController(_ coachMarksController: CoachMarksController, willHide coachMark: CoachMark, at index: Int)
```

Third, when all coach marks have been displayed. `didEndShowingBySkipping` specify whether the flow completed because the user requested it to end.

```swift    
func coachMarksController(_ coachMarksController: CoachMarksController, didEndShowingBySkipping skipped: Bool)
```

##### React when the user tap the overlay #####

Whenever the user will tap the overlay, you will get notified through:

```swift    
func shouldHandleOverlayTap(in coachMarksController: CoachMarksController, at index: Int) -> Bool
```

Returning `true` will let Instructions continue the flow normally, while returning `false` will interrupt it. If you choose to interrupt the flow, you're responsible for either stopping or pausing it or manually show the next coach marks (see [Piloting the flow from the code](#piloting-the-flow-from-the-code)).

`index` is the index of the coach mark currently displayed.

##### Performing animations before showing coach marks #####
You can perform animation on views, before or after showing a given coach mark.
For instance, you might want to collapse a table view and show only its header, before referring to those headers with a coach mark. Instructions offers a simple way to insert your own animations into the flow.

For instance, let's say you want to perform an animation _before_ a coach mark shows.
You'll implement some logic into the `coachMarkWillShow` delegate method.
To ensure you don't have to hack something up and turn asynchronous animation blocks into synchronous ones, you can pause the flow, perform the animation and then start the flow again. This will ensure your UI never get stalled.

```swift
func coachMarksController(_ coachMarksController: CoachMarksController, willShow coachMark: inout CoachMark, at index: Int) {
	 // Pause to be able to play the animation and then show the coach mark.
    coachMarksController.flow.pause()

    // Run the animation
    UIView.animateWithDuration(1, animations: { () -> Void in
        …
    }, completion: { (finished: Bool) -> Void in
        // Once the animation is completed, we update the coach mark,
        // and start the display again. Since inout parameters cannot be
        // captured by the closure, you can use the following method to update
        // the coachmark. It will only work if you paused the flow.
        coachMarksController.helper.updateCurrentCoachMarkForView(myView)
        coachMarksController.flow.resume()
    })
}
```

⚠️ Since the blurring overlay snapshots the view during coach mark appearance/disappearance,
you should make sure that animations targeting your own view don't occur while a coach mark
is appearing or disappearing. Otherwise, the animation won't be visible.

You may also want to customize the properties defining the of for the classic transparency overlay, as Instructions will fall back to using the classic type if `UIAccessibilityIsReduceTransparencyEnabled()` returns true.

##### Skipping a coach mark

You can skip a given coach mark by implementing the following method defined in `CoachMarksControllerDelegate`:

```swift
func coachMarksController(_ coachMarksController: CoachMarksController, coachMarkWillLoadAt index: Int) -> Bool
```

`coachMarkWillLoadAt:` is called right before a given coach mark will show. To prevent a CoachMark from showing, you can return `false` from this method.

##### Customizing ornaments of the overlay

It's possible to add custom views which will be displayed over the overlay by implementing the following method of `CoachMarksControllerDelegate`:

```swift
func coachMarksController(_ coachMarksController: CoachMarksController,
                          configureOrnamentsOfOverlay overlay: UIView)
```

Just add the ornaments to the provided view (`overlay`) and Instructions should take care of the rest. Please note, however, that these ornaments will be displayed over the cutout, but under the coach marks.

#### Dealing with frame changes

Since Instructions doesn't hold any reference to the _views of interest_, it cannot respond to their
change of frame automatically.

Instructions provide two methods to deal with frame changes.

- `CoachMarkController.prepareForChange()`, called before a change of frame, to hide
  the coach mark and the cutout path.
- `CoachMarkController.restoreAfterChangeDidComplete()`, called after a change of frame
  to show the coach mark and the cutout again.

Although you can call these methods at any time while Instructions is idle, the result will not
look smooth if the coach mark is already displayed. It's make the changes occur between
two coach marks, by pausing and resuming the flow. [`KeyboardViewController`] shows an
example of this technique.

[`KeyboardViewController`]: https://github.com/ephread/Instructions/blob/master/Examples/Example/KeyboardViewController.swift

### Usage within App Extensions
If you wish to add Instructions within App Extensions, there's additional work you need to perform.
An example is available in the `App Extensions Example/` directory.

#### Dependencies
Instructions comes with two shared schemes, `Instructions` and `InstructionsAppExtensions`. The only differences between the two is that `InstructionsAppExtensions` does not depend upon the `UIApplication.sharedApplication()`, making it suitable for App Extensions.

In the following examples, let's consider a project with two targets, one for a regular application (`Instructions App Extensions Example`) and another for an app extension (`Keyboard Extension`).

#### CocoaPods

If you're importing Instructions with CocoaPods, you'll need to edit your `Podfile` to make it look
like this:

```ruby
target 'Instructions App Extensions Example' do
  pod 'Instructions', '~> 1.0.0'
end

target 'Keyboard Extension' do
  pod 'InstructionsAppExtensions', '~> 1.0.0'
end
```

If Instructions is only imported from within App Extension target, you don't need the first block.

When compiling either targets, CocoaPods will make sure the appropriate flags are set, thus
allowing/forbidding calls to `UIApplication.sharedApplication()`.
You don't need to change your code.

#### Frameworks (Carthage / Manual management)

If you're importing Instructions through frameworks, you'll notice that the two shared schemes
(`Instructions` and `InstructionsAppExtensions`) both result in different frameworks.

You need to embed both frameworks and link them to the proper targets.
Make sure they look like theses:

**Instructions App Extensions Example**
![Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/3M3BQaO.png)

**Keyboard Extension**
![Imgur](http://i.imgur.com/LAtV0oA.png)

If you plan to add Instructions only to the App Extension target, you don't need to add `Instructions.frameworks`.

##### Import statements

When importing Instructions from files within `Instructions App Extensions Example`,
you should use the regular import statement:

```swift
import Instructions
```

However, when importing Instructions from files within `Keyboard Extension`, you should
use the specific statement:

```swift
import InstructionsAppExtensions
```

⚠️ **Please be extremely careful**, as you will be able to import regular _Instructions_
from within an app extension without breaking anything. It will work. However, you're at a
high risk of rejection from the Apple Store. Uses of `UIApplication.sharedApplication()`
are statically checked during compilation but nothing prevents you from performing the calls
at runtime. Fortunately Xcode should warn you if you've mistakenly linked with a framework
not suited for App Extensions.
